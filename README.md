This folder should be inside ~/catkin_ws/src
e.g. ~/catkin_ws/src/rover/

1. Building

$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_build

To test, doing:
$ rosmsg list | grep rover/

Should show (maybe more):

rover/Motor
rover/Servo

2. Launch ROS nodes:

```
~/rover/launch_gui.sh
```

This is somewhat equivalent to:

```
roslaunch rover drive.launch
```

But lets us also monitor the nodes, restart them, etc.

To make this launch automatically on startup, make it a systemd service:

```
cd ~/rover
sudo cp rover.service /lib/systemd/system
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable rover.service
```

3. Examples:
   To manually make motor front left move forward at 60% speed:

    $ rostopic pub -1 /motor_cmd rover/Motor -- 60 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

    And backwards at 50% speed

    $ rostopic pub -1 /motor_cmd rover/Motor -- -50 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

    To shut off all motors:

    $ rostopic pub -1 /motor_cmd rover/Motor -- 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

    (Note that 0 is a special case that is taken to mean to cut power to the motor,
     rather than to hold)

    To move all the servos to 1 degree:

    $ rostopic pub -1 /servo_cmd rover/Servo -- 1 1 1 1 0 0

    And 30 degrees:

    $ rostopic pub -1 /servo_cmd rover/Servo -- 30 30 30 30 0 0

    And turn them all off

    $ rostopic pub -1 /servo_cmd rover/Servo -- 0 0 0 0 0 0
